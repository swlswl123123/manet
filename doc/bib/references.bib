  abstract = {Increasingly, directional antennas are being used in wireless networks. Such antennas can improve the quality of individual links and decrease overall interference. However, the interaction of environmental effects with signal directionality is not well understood. We observe that state of the art simulators make simplifying assumptions which are often unrealistic and can give a misleading picture of application layer performance. Because simulators are often used for prototyping and validating new ideas, their realism and accuracy are of primary importance. In this paper, we apply a new empirical simulation method for directional antennas and study how well this models reality. We show that not only is our model easy to implement, but is also more accurate and thus better able to predict the performance of propagation-sensitive applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a fast systolic priority queue architecture usable in a traffic manager. The purpose of the traffic manager is to schedule the departure of packets on egress ports in a network processing unit. In the context of this work, this scheduling should ensure that packets are sent in such a way to meet the allowed bandwidth quotas for each packet flow. Also, an important goal is to reduce latency to a minimum in order to best support the upcoming 5G wireless standards. The proposed hardware architecture of the systolic priority queue enables pipelined en/dequeue operations at constant time rate. Detailed description of this processing module is provided, together with the associated algorithm, and the architecture of the traffic manager. The implemented architecture is based on the C coding language and is synthesized with the Vivado High Level Synthesis tool. The obtained results are compared across a range of priority queue depths and performance metrics with existing approaches. A throughput improvement of 44\% is claimed over best previously reported results. The proposed design of the traffic manager works at 118 MHz when implemented on a Kintex-7 FPGA from Xilinx.},

  abstract = {Wireless communications using ad hoc networks are receiving an increasing interest. The most attractive feature of ad hoc networks is the flexibility. The network is set up by a number of units in an ad hoc manner, without the need of any fixed infrastructure. Communication links are established between two units if the signal strength is sufficiently high. As not all pairs of nodes can establish direct links, the traffic between two units may have to be relayed through other units. This is known as the multihop functionality. Design of ad hoc networks is a challenging task. In this paper we study the problem of resource allocation with spatial TDMA (STDMA) as the access control scheme. Previous work for this problem has mainly focused on heuristics, whose performance is difficult to analyze when optimal solutions are not known. We develop, for both node-oriented and link-oriented allocation strategies, mathematical programming formulations for resource optimization. We further present a column generation approach, which, in our numerical experiments, constantly yields optimal or near-optimal solutions. Our results provide important benchmarks when evaluating heuristic on-line algorithms for resource optimization using STDMA.},

TCP's implicit AIMD flow control performs poorly in this environment, because it often cannot keep up with the dynamics of the network. This paper explores the potential utility of explicit flow control in the MANET domain. To this end, we propose an end-to-end rate-based flow control scheme (called EXACT), where a flow's allowed rate is explicitly conveyed from intermediate routers to the end-hosts in each data packet's special control header. As a result, EXACT reacts quickly and precisely to re-routing and bandwidth variation, which makes it especially suitable for a dynamic MANET network and also discusses several supporting mechanisms required for such a scheme at the MAC and the transport layers. By ns-2 simulations, we show that EXACT outperforms TCP in terms of fairness and efficiency, especially in a highly dynamic MANET environment.},

  abstract = {Previous research in wireless ad hoc networks typically assumes the use of omnidirectional antennas at all nodes. With omnidirectional antennas, while two nodes are communicating using a given channel, MAC protocols such as IEEE 802.11 require all other nodes in the vicinity to stay silent. With directional antennas, two pairs of nodes located in each other's vicinity may potentially communicate simultaneously, depending on the directions of transmission. This can increase spatial reuse of the wireless channel. In addition, the higher gain of directional antennas allows a node to communicate with other nodes located far away, implying that messages could be delivered to the destination in fewer hops. In this paper, we propose a MAC protocol that exploits the characteristics of directional antennas. Our design focuses on using multi-hop RTSs to establish links between distant nodes, and then transmit CTS, DATA and ACK over a single hop. Results show that our directional MAC protocol can perform better than IEEE 802.11, although we find that the performance is dependent on the topology configuration and the flow patterns in the system.},

  abstract = {This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol is an optimization of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN. The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process. This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message. In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs. Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network. As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors. Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information is distributed in the network. This information is then used for route calculation. OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops). The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this context.},

  abstract = {The use of directional antennas in wireless networks has been widely studied with two main motivations: 1) decreasing interference between devices and 2) improving power efficiency. We identify a third motivation for utilizing directional antennas: pushing the range limitations of full-duplex wireless communication. A characterization of full-duplex performance in the context of a base station transmitting to one device while receiving from another is presented. In this scenario, the base station can exploit ``directional diversity'' by using directional antennas to achieve additional passive suppression of the self-interference. The characterization shows that at 10 m distance and with 12 dBm transmit power the gains over half-duplex are as high as 90\% and no lower than 60\% as long as the directional antennas at the base station are separated by 45\textdegree{} or more. At 15 m distance the gains are no lower than 40\% for separations of 90\textdegree{} and larger. Passive suppression via directional antennas also allows full-duplex to achieve significant gains over half-duplex even without resorting to the use of extra hardware for performing RF cancellation as has been required in the previous work.},

F-heaps support arbitrary deletion from an n-item heap in O(log n) amortized time and all other standard heap operations in O(1) amortized time. Using F-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms. In particular, we obtain the following worst-case bounds, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges in the problem graph:  O(n log n + m) for the single-source shortest path problem with nonnegative edge lengths, improved from O(mlog(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the all-pairs shortest path problem, improved from O(nm log(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the assignment problem (weighted bipartite matching), improved from O(nmlog(m/n+2)n);  O(m{$\beta$}(m, n)) for the minimum spanning tree problem, improved from O(mlog log(m/n+2)n); where {$\beta$}(m, n) = min \{i | log(i)n {$\leq$} m/n\}. Note that {$\beta$}(m, n) {$\leq$} log*n if m {$\geq$} n.

In this paper, we first demonstrate that one important reason of the poor performance is the close coupling between medium contention and network congestion. Therefore, we present a framework of distributed flow control and medium access control to address both medium contention and network congestion. The proposed scheme utilizes the MAC layer control frames to efficiently conduct the network layer's flow control function and only allows the upstream nodes to forward enough packets to make it possible for the downstream nodes to fully utilize the shared channel but never introduce severe MAC collisions and network congestion. Extensive simulations illustrate that the proposed scheme well controls congestion and greatly alleviates medium collisions. It achieves up to 12 times the end-to-end throughput of IEEE 802.11, maintains a short delay and a low control overhead, and improves the fairness regardless of the hop count and the traffic load},

SPACE-MAC prevents interference between such pairs by selectively nulling the signals from potentially interfering transmissions. This is achieved in a totally distributed fashion utilizing channel state information (CSI) at both transmitter and receiver to adjust antennas weights for each packet transmission. SPACE-MAC can operate effectively in cluttered (e.g., indoor) environments. SPACE-MAC achieves spatial reuse without requiring a separate channel for exchanging channel state information. This allows considerably better channel utilization. We investigate performance improvements of SPACE-MAC with respect to IEEE 802.11 DCF MAC using omnidirectional antennas.},

This, in turn, increases the importance of bandwidth efficiency while maintaining tight requirements on energy consumption, delay and jitter. Coordinated channel access protocols have been shown to be well suited for highly loaded MANETs under uniform load distributions. However, these protocols are in general not as well suited for non-uniform load distributions as uncoordinated channel access protocols due to the lack of on-demand dynamic channel allocation mechanisms that exist in infrastructure based coordinated protocols. In this paper, we present a lightweight dynamic channel allocation mechanism and a cooperative load balancing strategy that are applicable to cluster based MANETs to address this problem. We present protocols that utilize these mechanisms to improve performance in terms of throughput, energy consumption and inter-packet delay variation (IPDV). Through extensive simulations we show that both dynamic channel allocation and cooperative load balancing improve the bandwidth efficiency under non-uniform load distributions compared to protocols that do not use these mechanisms as well as compared to the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol with GTS mechanism and the IEEE 802.11 uncoordinated protocol.},

The stations that receive the directional RTS, using a simple scheme of tracking the neighbors' directions, defer their transmission toward the beams that could harm the ongoing communication. In this way, the proposed protocol takes advantage of the benefits of directional transmissions as the increase of spatial reuse and of coverage range. Additionally, it reduces the hidden-terminal problem, as well as the deafness problem, two main factors for the decrease of the efficiency of directional transmissions in ad hoc networks. The performance evaluation of the protocol shows that it offers a significant improvement in static, as well as mobile, scenarios, as compared to the performance of the proposed protocols that use omnidirectional or directional transmissions.},

This paper shows that controlling the offered load at the sources can eliminate these problems. To verify the simulation results, we set up a real 6-node multi-hop network. The experimental measurements confirm the existence of the optimal offered load. In addition, we provide an analysis to estimate the optimal offered load that maximizes the throughput of a multi-hop traffic flow. We believe this is a first paper in the literature to provide a quantitative analysis (as opposed to simulation) for the impact of hidden nodes and signal capture on sustainable throughput. The analysis is based on the observation that a large-scale 802.11 network with hidden nodes is a network in which the carrier-sensing capability breaks down partially. Its performance is therefore somewhere between that of a carrier-sensing network and that of an Aloha network. Indeed, our analytical closed-form solution has the appearance of the throughput equation of the Aloha network. Our approach allows one to identify whether the performance of an 802.11 network is hidden-node limited or spatial-reuse limited},

  abstract = {Address allocation is an important issue in Mobile ad hoc networks. This thesis proposes solutions to assign unique IP addresses to nodes participating in Mobile ad hoc networks and evaluates the proposed solutions.  Address allocation protocols such as DHCP are centralized in nature. In Mobile ad hoc networks, due to the lack of a central server, such protocols are not very suitable. In order to truly be a network of peers, a MANET requires a distributed algorithm for address assignment. Therefore, mechanisms like DHCP are not sufficient to assign IP addresses in the MANET environment when nodes enter and leave the MANET group at their will. This thesis proposes a distributed algorithm "Dynamic Address Allocation Protocol". This protocol takes the concept of the central node allocating the IP address but the functionality of the central node is distributed among all the nodes. This protocol uses mac addresses to identify network merging. This thesis also proposes another solution in which unique identifiers are sent along with the routing messages, which help to distinguish between duplicate addresses, and thus provide a way to uniquely identify a node.},

Harnessing this potential, however, requires new mechanisms at the medium access and network layers for intelligently and adaptively exploiting the antenna system. While recent years have seen a surge of research into such mechanisms, the problem of developing a complete ad hoc networking system, including the unique challenge of real-life prototype development and experimentation has not been addressed. In this paper, we present utilizing directional antennas for ad hoc networking (UDAAN). UDAAN is an interacting suite of modular network- and medium access control (MAC)-layer mechanisms for adaptive control of steered or switched antenna systems in an ad hoc network. UDAAN consists of several new mechanisms-a directional power-controlled MAC, neighbor discovery with beamforming, link characterization for directional antennas, proactive routing and forwarding-all working cohesively to provide the first complete systems solution. We also describe the development of a real-life ad hoc network testbed using UDAAN with switched directional antennas, and we discuss the lessons learned during field trials. High fidelity simulation results, using the same networking code as in the prototype, are also presented both for a specific scenario and using random mobility models. For the range of parameters studied, our results show that UDAAN can produce a very significant improvement in throughput over omnidirectional communications.},

Such enhancements include "aggressive" and "conservative" channel access models for beamforming antennas, link power control, and directional neighbor discovery. Our simulations are based on detailed modeling on detailed modeling of steered as well as swiched beams using antenna patterns of varying gains, and a realistic radio and propagation model. For the scenarios studied, our results show that beamforming can yield a 28\% to 118\% (depending upon the density) improvement in throughput, and up to a factor-of-28 reduction in delay.

Guided by a set of local feasibility conditions, multi-hop sessions are dynamically offered allocations, further translated to link demands. Using a distributed Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol nodes adapt to the demand changes on their adjacent links by local, conflict-free slot reassignments. As soon as the demand changes stabilize, the nodes must incrementally converge to a TDMA schedule that realizes the global link (and session) demand allocation.We first derive sufficient local feasibility conditions for certain topology classes and show that trees can be maximally utilized.We then introduce a converging distributed link scheduling algorithm that exploits the logical tree structure that arises in several ad hoc network applications.Decoupling bandwidth allocation to multi-hop sessions from link scheduling allows support of various end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) objectives. We focus on the max-min fairness (MMF) objective and design an end-to-end asynchronous distributed algorithm for the computation of the session MMF rates. Once the end-to-end algorithm converges, the link scheduling algorithm converges to a TDMA schedule that realizes these rates.We demonstrate the applicability of this framework through an implementation over an existing wireless technology. This implementation is free of restrictive assumptions of previous TDMA approaches: it does not require any a-priori knowledge on the number of nodes in the network nor even network-wide slot synchronization.},

  abstract = {Ad hoc mobile networks are composed of mobile nodes communicating through wireless medium, without any fixed backbone infrastructure. In these networks, congestion occurs in any intermediate node when data packets travel from source to destination and they incur high packet loss and long delay, which cause the performance degradations of a network. This paper proposes an early congestion detection and adaptive routing in MANET called as EDAPR. Initially EDAPR constructs a NHN (non-congested neighbors) neighbors list and finds a route to a destination through an NHN node. All the primary path nodes periodically calculate its queue\_status at node level. While using early congestion detection technique, node detects congestion that is likely to happen and sends warning message to NHN nodes. The ancestor NHN node is aware of this situation and finds an alternate path to a destination immediately by applying adaptive path mechanism. Thus, EDAPR improves performance in terms of reducing delay, routing overhead and increases packet delivery ratio without incurring any significant additional cost. The performance of EDAPR was compared with EDAODV and EDCSCAODV using the Ns-2 simulator. The result reveals significant improvement over EDAODV and EDCSCAODV routing schemes.},

  abstract = {Auto-configuration is a desirable goal in implementing mobile ad hoc networks. Specifically, automated dynamic assignment (without manual intervention) of IP addresses is desirable. In traditional networks, such dynamic address assignment is often performed using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Implementing DHCP, however, requires access to a DHCP server. In mobile ad hoc networks, it is difficult to guarantee access to a DHCP server, since ad hoc networks can become partitioned due to host mobility. Therefore, alternative mechanisms must be employed. One plausible approach is to allow a node to pick a tentative address randomly (or using some locally available information), and then use a "duplicate address detection" (DAD) procedure to detect duplicate addresses. The previously proposed DAD procedures make use of timeouts and do not always perform correctly in presence of partitions. In networks where message delays cannot be bounded, use of timeouts can lead to unreliability. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach (which can be used in conjunction with previously proposed schemes). We refer to the proposed approach as "weak" duplicate address detection. The goal of weak DAD is to prevent a packet from being routed to the "wrong" destination node, even if two nodes in the network happen to have chosen the same IP address. We also propose an enhanced version of the weak DAD scheme, which removes a potential shortcoming of the weak DAD approach.},

In this paper, we first explore the design space of directional MAC and present a taxonomy of existing schemes. Then, we discuss the major problems in using directional antennas under different category of MAC schemes. After that, we propose coordinated directional medium access control (CDMAC), a novel directional MAC protocol to improve throughput via facilitating the simultaneous contention-free communications for multiple local node-pairs. We evaluate our CDMAC, one representative existing scheme and IEEE 802.11 via extensive ns2 simulations.

Proposed metrics specify continuity and synchronization, with tolerable limits on average and bursty defaults from perfect continuity, timing and synchronization constraints. These metrics can be used in a distributed environment for resource allocation. Continuity specification of a CM stream consists of its sequencing, display rate and drift profiles. The sequencing profile of a CM stream consists of tolerable aggregate and consecutive frame miss ratios. Rate profiles specify the average rendition rate and its variation. Given a rate profile, the ideal time unit for frame display is determined as an offset from the beginning of the stream. Drift profile specifies the average and bursty deviation of schedules for frames from such fixed points in time. Synchronization requirements of a collection of CM streams are specified by mixing, rate and synchronization drift profiles. Mixing profiles specify vectors of frames that can be displayed simultaneously. They consist of average and bursty losses of synchronization. Rate profiles consist of average rates and permissible deviations thereof. Synchronization drift profiles specify permissible aggregate and bursty time drifts between schedules of simultaneously displayable frames. It is shown that rate profiles of a collection of synchronized streams is definable in terms of rate profiles of its component streams. It is also shown that mixing and drift profiles of a collection of streams are non-definable in terms of sequencing and drift profiles of its constituents. An important consequence of the mutual independence of synchronization and continuity specification is that, in a general purpose platform with limited resources, synchronized display of CM streams may require QoS tradeoffs. An algorithm that makes such tradeoffs is presented as a proof of applicability of our metrics in a realistic environment.},

Current MAC protocols, such as the IEEE 802.11 standard, do not benefit when using directional antennas, because these protocols have been designed for omnidirectional antennas. In this paper, we attempt to design new MAC protocols suitable for ad hoc networks based on directional antennas.},

  abstract = {Most address allocation schemes rely on broadcasting for address solicitation and/or duplicate address detection. In this paper, we propose a Prime DHCP scheme that can allocate addresses to the hosts of a MANET without broadcasting over the whole MANET. Prime DHCP makes each host a DHCP proxy of the MANET and run a prime numbering address allocation algorithm individually to compute unique addresses for address allocation. The concept of DHCP proxies and the prime numbering address allocation algorithm together eliminate the needs for broadcasting in the MANET. Performance results show that Prime DHCP can significantly reduce the signal overhead and the latency for hosts to acquire addresses.},
